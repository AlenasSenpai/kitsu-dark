## Installation

### Step 1. - Get a scriptmanager extension.

This website restyling is a userscript, so you'll need to make sure you have a scriptmanager installed for your browser of choice, if you don't have one then you can get one below:

[Chrome](https://tampermonkey.net)

[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey)

[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey)

### Step 2. - Install the theme.

Now to the theme, click [here](https://github.com/misarasglow/kitsu-dark/raw/master/kitsu.io-dark-theme.user.js), the scriptmanager
should take over and ask you to install. Just click "Install" or "Yes".

After you installed it, you should be able to simply refresh Kitsu to see the changes.

## Troubleshooting
 
If it doesn't work, you need to ensure that it was installed properly and that the script is enabled.

### Troublshooting on Chrome
If Tampermonkey doesn't look like this:

then make sure it's enabled by clicking the logo and clicking the toggle:

If that doesn't work, then it is likely you didn't install the script. [Try Again.](https://github.com/misarasglow/kitsu-dark/raw/master/kitsu.io-dark-theme.user.js)

### Troubleshooting on Firefox
Make sure your Greasemonkey is enabled and the script is enabled like this:

If you don't see the kitsu.io dark theme script there then you might not have installed it correctly. [Try Again.](https://github.com/misarasglow/kitsu-dark/raw/master/kitsu.io-dark-theme.user.js)
