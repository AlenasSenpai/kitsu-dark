## kitsu.io dark theme

A nice and clean darker theme for kitsu.io

## Installation

This website restyling is a userscript for tampermonkey, so you need to make sure you have it installed for your browser of choice, if you don't you can find it here: https://tampermonkey.net/

### Theme time

Now to the theme, you should hopefully still be on github for this, so at this stage, click the filename: https://i.gyazo.com/da0e16e0cfe89c0f4f6bf5579bdff108.png and you'll see the full code for
 the theme, you should also see a row of buttons that look like this: https://i.gyazo.com/7d1a264b045e8aa3fe62c97b98dae2ba.png if you click the raw button with tampermonkey installed, tampermonkey
 should take over and ask you to install, click yes, it should already be enabled and will just need a page refresh, but if it doesn't open up the context menu for tampermonkey by clicking this 
 icon: https://i.gyazo.com/5194c1610e529ecee185cc776ff0f596.png to the right of the address bar, this will bring out and menu that should be similar to: https://i.gyazo.com/9be8510eaa274285b49486f89a084310.png 
 click dashboard and it will give you a list of any userscripts you have install and in there should be: https://i.gyazo.com/439fafb95b186f7f7cbdb0afd73dfc83.png , make sure it's enabled and you're done, 
 just refresh the page on kitsu.io
